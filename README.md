# Discord-Rich-Presence-Javascript

discord rich presence in javascript so it can show on you discord profile lol

am already has everything installed here but you still need to do all the fancy commands in vsc or what ever you are editing this on becuz so can open index.js lol

first to start this thing
download this and then go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and download node for you device you are on,
next setup the node thing and then it should be ready to use (maybe use a tutourial),
next open vsc and open the terminal in vsc (you can skip this step becuz am already has package.json and package-lock.json), in the terminal type "npm init" and also type "npm i discord-rpc" and it should add 2 new files package.json and package-lock.json when you use npm init, it gona ask some questions about a lisence, package name, description and other things,
next edit the index.js file with you things you want and the client id,
to get client id and images go here and create a new application https://discord.com/developers/applications,
images has to be 512x512 so go here to scale images https://convert-my-image.com/ImageConverter

NOW we must open the index.js file,
make sure has discord open and make sure the desktop verison not the browser one,
in you folder you is editing index.js in click the file button on the left top corner and then open powershell if you are on windows (idk for other devices),
next in the powershell terminal thing type "node index.js" and it should show on you discord profile! eyyeyeyey,
NOW PRANK YOU FRENS YOU ARE PLAYING A EXPENISE GAEM HAHAHAHHAHAHHA,
