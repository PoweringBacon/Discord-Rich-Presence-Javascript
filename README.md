# Discord-Rich-Presence-Javascript

discord rich presence in javascript so it can show on you discord profile lol

am already has everything installed here but you still need to do all the fancy commands in vsc or what ever you are editing this on becuz so can open index.js lol

first to start this thing
download this and then go to nodejs.org and download node for you device you are on,
next setup the node thing and then it should be ready to use (maybe use a tutourial),
next open vsc and open the terminal in vsc, in the terminal type "npm init" and also type "npm i discord-rpc",
next edit the index.js file with you things you want and the client id

NOW we must open the index.js file,
make sure has discord open and make sure the desktop verison not the browser one,
in you folder you is editing index.js in click the file button on the left top corner and then open powershell if you are on windows (idk for other devices),
next in the powershell terminal thing type "node index.js" and it should show on you discord profile! eyyeyeyey,
NOW PRANK YOU FRENS YOU ARE PLAYING A EXPENISE GAEM HAHAHAHHAHAHHA,
